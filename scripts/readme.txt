These are some usefull script when using PASTT (android-php-translator) online.

diff-online-translations

This script gets all the resources from your web and copies the latest versions right into your Android app SBN development directory. Requires ncftp and php5-cli. Since I custom-wrote this for my own 'transdroid' app, you need to do some renaming and setting the correct paths.

send-base-translation

This script puts your current local copy of the base translation (res/values/strings.xml) to your online FTP server. Requires ncftp.
